## Stretch Goal

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Setting up the server took some time to figure out again and record the process of doing so. Even with template, I needed to run several test to make sure that I was doing the right thing.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).
